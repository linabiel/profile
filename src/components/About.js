                A motivated professional who enjoys continuous learning. My creative approach to problem solving inspired me to take on coding. After gaining valuable theoretical knowledge studying for the masters in Information Technology, I felt the program lacked practical skills. The Professional Software Development course at CodeClan filled that gap and gave me the skills necessary to start a new career in tech. While at CodeClan, I mostly enjoyed the creative process of building apps, bouncing ideas with colleagues and fixing bugs.
